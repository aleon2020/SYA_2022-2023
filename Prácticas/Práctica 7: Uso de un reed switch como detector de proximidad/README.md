# Pr√°ctica 7: Uso de un reed switch como detector de proximidad

## 1. Personal opinion on this practice

This practice was very easy for me to complete, as it took me very little time to create both the code and the connection diagram. To further specify the use of the reed switch, I adapted the program so that,
initially, when we finish running the program, the LED is off and the screen indicates that the circuit is closed; and when we bring a magnet close to it, the two metal pins inside the reed switch separate, and therefore, the circuit opens and is indicated by the LED lighting up.
